  			<h3>Brief description</h3>
  			In this bubble chart, each course is drawn as a circle on a two or multiple dimensional plot. Each course in the database has the following features: Mode, Level, Sector, Price, Duration, Langue. These features will be represented through different dimensions in the visualisation. Clearly the visualisation with all the sectors is too cluttered and is un-informative. However on selecting a particular sector, only those courses belonging to the sector will be shown thereby making it easy to use.

			The feature Mode can take one of the values: Distance, Continu, Cours du soir, Cours dâ€™emploi, Partiellement presentiel, and forms the X-axis of the plot.
